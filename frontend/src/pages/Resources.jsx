      question: "How accurate are the disease predictions?",
      answer:
        "Our AI model has been trained on millions of medical cases and achieves an accuracy rate of over 85% for common conditions. However, it's important to remember that our tool is meant to be informative, not diagnostic. Always consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my health data secure?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we take data security very seriously. All your health information is encrypted and stored securely. We are HIPAA compliant and never share your personal health information with third parties without your explicit consent.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use HealthPredict instead of seeing a doctor?",
      answer:
        "No, HealthPredict is designed to be a supplementary tool, not a replacement for professional medical care. Our predictions can help you better understand potential conditions and when to seek medical attention, but they should not be used for self-diagnosis or treatment.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I use the symptom checker?",
      answer:
        "You can use our symptom checker whenever you experience concerning symptoms. However, for ongoing or worsening symptoms, we recommend consulting with a healthcare provider rather than repeatedly using our tool.",
    },
